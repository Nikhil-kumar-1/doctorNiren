        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-6">What is Circumcision Surgery?</h2>
        <p>
          Circumcision surgery in Delhi involves removing the foreskin from the tip of the penis. The loose skin known as the foreskin protects the top portion of the penis from birth. This quick procedure usually takes approximately 30 minutes under local anaesthesia. The majority of patients report low levels of pain during the surgery. Recovery is quick, and most patients return to routine tasks within a week following surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advances in technology have made circumcision surgery more secure and relaxing than before. It is minimally invasive and has great cosmetic outcomes with minimal scarring and results that are permanent.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-6">Advantages of Circumcision Surgery</h2>
        <p>
          Circumcision surgery is very beneficial as it has many health and lifestyle advantages that can enhance your life. The procedure improves personal cleanliness since daily washing becomes easier and more efficient. It eliminates the risk of smegma accumulation. This minimises the chances of bacteria building up under the foreskin, thus better long-term genital health.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a medical perspective, Circumcision surgery treatment in Delhi offers a significant level of protection against different diseases. This surgery greatly minimises the possibility of developing urinary tract infections and reduces the likelihood of penile cancer. It also reduces the likelihood of cervical cancer in female partners and various sexually transmitted diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Circumcision surgery treats several diseases that lead to complications. Just like, preventing conditions like phimosis and paraphimosis. If you don't receive treatment on-time, such medical conditions may become uncomfortable and even dangerous. Circumcision does away with these risks completely and also makes examination easier and more effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many individuals opt for this surgery for social and cultural reasons. The procedure meets the religious and cultural needs of many communities, providing a sense of cultural identity and belonging. This aspect can be especially crucial to families wanting to preserve their culture and beliefs. Also, many men report improved self-confidence and body image after the procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefits of circumcision surgery are lifelong and are not actually limited to the early years of a boy’s life. The surgery also lowers the lifetime risk of penile issues and minimises the chances of future operations. It ensures better hygiene throughout life and makes regular medical check-ups more straightforward. Many patients experience improved psychological well-being, reporting reduced anxiety about intimate relationships.
