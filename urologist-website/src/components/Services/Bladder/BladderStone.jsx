        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-6">Why Consider Bladder Stone Surgery?</h2>
        <p>

          <li><strong>Long-lasting Results:</strong> Unlike temporary solutions, bladder stone surgery provides a permanent solution by physically removing the stones from your bladder. This means you can enjoy lasting relief from symptoms and reduced risk of future complications.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost-Effective Treatment:</strong> While bladder stone surgery cost in Delhi seems expensive, it often proves more cost-effective in the long run.

        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-6">Bladder Stone Surgery Procedure</h2>
        <p>
          At our practice, we safely and successfully remove bladder stones through surgery using the latest techniques. The specific steps involved in our bladder stone surgery include:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">1. Anaesthesia and Preparation</h3>
        <p>
          Before beginning the surgical procedure, our well-trained urologists will inject a local anaesthetic into the area around the bladder. This ensures that the surgical procedure won't cause you any pain. We will get the treatment site ready after making sure the area is appropriately numbed.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">2. Cystoscope Insertion</h3>
        <p>
          The next procedure involves inserting a cystoscope—a small, flexible tube—into the urethra. Then, our bladder stone specialist in Delhi inserts a cystoscope inside the bladder. This provides our specialist with a greatly enlarged view of the bladder and the stone's position.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">3. Stone Fragmentation</h3>
        <p>
          After the stones are clearly identified, our urologists will then leverage various instruments to fragment the stones. Using advanced laser technology, our team effectively breaks down the stones. This method avoids large cuts and ensures a less invasive approach to fragmenting the stones.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">4. Stone Removal</h3>
        <p>
          Once the stones have been carefully broken, our team will then use the cystoscope. This efficiently removes the bladder of the tiny pieces of the stone. To speed up the healing process, this procedure helps ensure that the bladder is clear of any remaining calculi.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">5. Closure and Recovery</h3>
        <p>
          Following the removal of the stones, the treatment region is precisely sutured and the cystoscope is carefully removed. After bladder stone surgery in Delhi, our professional will provide you with thorough instructions to ensure a smooth recovery.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the process of treating a bladder stone surgically, our nurses will continuously assess your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. They even make the necessary changes to make you as comfortable as possible. You can rest assured that you are in the hands of professionals who will do their best.

        <p>
          This is the most effective bladder stone treatment in Saket, Delhi. In this procedure, a cystoscope is passed through the natural urinary passage into the bladder to visualize the stone. After this, the stone is broken into small pieces with either laser or handheld pneumatic lithoclast. Stone fragments are then removed. After the procedure, a urinary catheter is left inside for a day or two. This surgery can be done as a daycare procedure and is an effective procedure for bladder stone removal.
